You need to install a version of matlab and run the main.m file .
 It contains a function call to arrange.m  to arrange all
 the given data in cell formats . The job done is collecting the 
data. Rearranging it, modifying the dates to readable days,
 filling gaps and concatenating the data to a single matrix and
 eventually a csv file.
